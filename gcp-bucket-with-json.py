'''
To access a specific storage bucket in Google Cloud with Python, you will need to use the google-auth and google-api-python-client libraries.
'''

# First, you will need to install the libraries:
# !pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

# Next, you will need to set up the necessary authentication credentials.
# You can do this using the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
# Once you have set up the credentials, you can use the following code to authenticate your Python script:

from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Replace the value of `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` with the path to your client secret JSON file.
# For example: '/path/to/client_secret.json'
creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_info(info=None, filename='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE')

# Now that you have the necessary credentials, you can use the `google-api-python-client` library to access your storage bucket.

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

# Replace the value of `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket.
bucket_name = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'

# Create a service client.
service = build('storage', 'v1', credentials=creds)

# Use the service client to access the bucket.
try:
    bucket = service.buckets().get(bucket=bucket_name).execute()
    print(f'Bucket {bucket_name} was found.')
except HttpError as error:
    print(f'An error occurred while trying to access the bucket: {error}')
